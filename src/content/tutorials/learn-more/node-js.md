# Getting started with node.js

Node.js is a scripting language that can be used to write back-end servers and command line tools. It's based on Javascript, the language used in web browsers, and there are many similarities. One of the most powerful features is its extensibility using packages. There's a huge library of them at [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/), the Node Package Manager. It also cross-platform, allowing easy use from Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems.

This document is a brief introduction to node.js and using the Particle Cloud API, designed for beginners moving from using things like curl and bash or MSDOS batch scripts to a more powerful, and, ultimately easier to use, full programming language environment.
